## Titanic Survival Exploration
One of the most infamous and tragic shipwrecks in history was the sinking of the RMS Titanic. According to the survivors and the available evidence, one of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

The power of machine learning can be used to predict which passengers were likely to survive the disaster. In order to find the most efficient machine learning algorithm to do that, I analyzed different machine learning algorithms like naive bayes, decision tree, logistic regression, support vector machines, k nearest neighbors, perceptron algorithm, stochastic gradient descent, random forest.
