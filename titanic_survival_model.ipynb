    "One of the most infamous and tragic shipwrecks in history was the sinking of the RMS Titanic. According to the survivors and the available evidence, one of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class."
